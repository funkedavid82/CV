Dear Sir/Ma,

 I am currently completing my Master of Science degree (Coursework and Research) in Mathematics at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Canada (\href{http://www.ubc.ca}{www.ubc.ca}). This cover letter is to support my application as one of the prospective participants in your program. I got the advertisement of this program through Professor Carlos Castillo-Chavez's visit to UBC, and would like to apply to be a participant.

\noindent Your advertisement confirmed for me that MTBI program is a program I would like to attend and enjoy the best experience. I am extremely impressed with the news I have heard about your program from Carlos  and particularly  the aspect of selecting and bringing undergraduate students from the field of Mathematics. As you will see from my CV, I have gained some experience through Graduate teaching and Research assistantship, Industrial training and a variety of part-time jobs, but would welcome the opportunity to explore the many interesting options in Mathematics, Science related fields and to develop within your reputable and environmentally-friendly area.

\noindent During my undergraduate research, I worked on a research project at Ladoke Akintola University of Technology and developed a mathematical model on HIV/AIDS. I was praised by my department on my meticulous approach and attention to details. Also, during my graduate research (Coursework), I worked on a research project at African Institute for Mathematical Sciences and developed a model for Analysis of Drug abuse and HIV infection. I am good at working independently and as part of a team. I have also grown accustomed to team work through my involvement in  music. I am convinced that my various student jobs in bank demonstrate that I am able to deal calmly with stressful situations and difficult people.

Please contact me should you require any further information or documentation.
I will welcome the opportunity to discuss this in an interview.
\closing{Sincerely yours},
%\end{letter}
