{\bf{\underline{Application for MMED 2015}}}
\end{center}
Dear Sir/Ma,

\noindent I am currently completing my Master of Science degree (Coursework and Research) in Applied Mathematics at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Canada (\href{http://www.ubc.ca}{www.ubc.ca}). I currently work on HIV-TB Co-infection Modelling under the supervision of Professor Fred Brauer. This letter is to support my application as one of the prospective participants in MMED 2015. I got the advertisement of this Clinic through AIMS mail, and will like to apply to be a participant.


\noindent Mathematics has increasingly been incorporated into various fields of life such as engineering, biomedical sciences, economics, social sciences among others. I have always wanted to apply my knowledge of mathematics in real-life phenomena. I intend to use mathematics as a tool for studying, understanding, and analyzing biological systems. My research interest includes mathematical modelling of infectious diseases, Numerical simulations and Bio-mathematics.

\noindent During my undergraduate research, I worked on a research project at Ladoke Akintola University of Technology and developed a mathematical model on HIV/AIDS. I was praised by my department on my meticulous approach and attention to details. Also, during my graduate research (Coursework), I worked on a research project at African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS South Africa) and developed a model for Analysis of Drug abuse and HIV infection. I am good at working independently and as part of a team. I have also grown accustomed to team work through my involvement in  music. I am convinced that my extensive academic background, research experience, programming skills, and other relevant skills have prepared me to take up a career in mathematical modelling and Epidemiology. In addition to this, I believe attending this clinic will give me an edge in understanding Data analysis, fitting models to data and also assist my research in general. I hope to make substantial contributions to the field of Mathematical Epidemiology and Mathematics and hope my researches will be beneficial to the University and the world at large. 
\closing{Yours Faithfully},
\end{letter}
